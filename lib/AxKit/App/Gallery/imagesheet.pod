=head1 NAME

AxKit::App::Gallery::imagesheet

=head1 DESCRIPTION

An imagesheet is generated by AxKit::App::Gallery whenever the user
requests a file that is in a directory for which AxKit::App::Gallery is 
the handler, and the C<format> parameter in the URL is C<html>.

The imagesheet is an XML document, and the last stylesheet in the imagesheet
processing chain should style this to HTML (or your final delivery
format).

=head1 IMAGESHEET STRUCTURE

The <imagesheet> element is almost identical to the <proofsheet> element.
The only differences are in the elements it is expected to contain.

Specifically, the <imagesheet> element contains all the elements of a
<proofsheet> except for:

=over 4

=item *

<albums>, and all its children.

=item *

<pages>, and all its children.

=back

In addition, there is no <images> element.  There will be exactly one
<image> element (as a child of the <imagesheet> element) that contains the
same information as the <image> elements in the <proofsheet> document.
