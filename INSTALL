AxKit::App::Gallery is installed in the traditional Perl manner;

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

However, it has a number of additional dependencies, many of which are
undergoing relatively rapid development.  This can make it difficult to
get a set of libraries installed which work properly.

These are notes from installing AxKit::App::Gallery on a clean FreeBSD
system.  As a minimum the libraries and modules here with these version
numbers are known to work.

If you're not familiar with FreeBSD's "portupgrade" command, the use of it
here ensures that the application/library/module is installed, and that
any of the libraries or applications that it depends on that might be out
of date are also installed.  Consult the documentation for your package
management tool (apt, rpm, ...) for equivalent functionality.

The "Installed" column notes what was installed, the "Using" column is 
either "Port", "CPAN", or "CVS".

Installed	Version		Using	Notes
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
apache 		1.3.29_1	Ports	

mod_perl	1.28		Ports

Data::Page	0.18		CPAN

Imager		0.41_1		Ports	Using the ports tree meant that
					Imager's other dependencies, such
					as libtiff, were pulled down and
					installed automatically.

Image::Info	1.16		CPAN

XML::Parser	2.34		CPAN

RDF::Core	0.30		CPAN

XML::LibXML	1.56		Ports	This has known bugs.  However,
					by installing it from the ports
					tree, I get all its dependencies
					installed as well.

XML::LibXML	1.57		CVS	First, delete XML::LibXML 1.56
					installed in the previous step.
					Then pull down 1.57 from the
					XML::LibXML CVS tree, and install
					using the traditional 
					"perl Makefile.PL" approach

XML::LibXSLT	1.53_1		Ports

GnuPG::Interface 0.33_1		Ports	Some of AxKit's dependencies need
					this, or they refuse to install.

AxKit		1.6.2		CPAN	During the install, ensure that
					you install XML::XPath when
					prompted.
