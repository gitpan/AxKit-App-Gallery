0.50  <date>

      - Stop using a home grown XML format for storing cached image
        information, and use a home grown RDF format instead.  This 
        completely changes the code needed to style the output to HTML or
        RSS, so any customisations you have made to the existing *2html.xsl
        stylesheets will probably need to be redone.

      - Added AxKit::App::Gallery::namespaces to document the namespaces
        used in the pipeline.

      - Commented out the debugging calls to log_error() that litter the code,
        until a more extensible logging system is implemented.

      - Made extractimageinfo.xps generic enough to be useful in the 
        imagesheet pipeline.

      - Use the filesystem path to each image as its key in the cache
        directory, rather than the image's URI.  This means that the same
        physical image available via multiple URIs will only be cached once.
        It also means that the existing contents of your cache directories
        are now out of date, and should be deleted.

      - Add a <server> block that includes information about the web server's
        configuration, which helps when constructing the protocol and hostname
        parts of a URL.

      - Use more of the image meta-data in the default output stylesheets.  In
        particular, show
            
            - More exposure details (focal length, F number, exposure program)
	    - Whether or not the flash fired

        and only display the data if it exists in the file.

      - Use a URI-encoding algorithm implemented in XSLT, reducing the amount
        of AxKit specific Perl code.

      - RSS output support.  Using AxKit's support for chaining stylesheets
        keyed off a 'style' parameter to enable a choice of output
        stylesheets.  With the correct entries in httpd.conf this means you
        can append '?style=rss' to a directory listing URL and get basic RSS
	suitable for syndicating to other web sites.

      - Added tests.  Granted, it's only to make sure that the POD files
        validate, but it's a start.
