AxKit::App::Gallery
===================

This is an AxKit based image gallery, using XSLT and XPathScript.  Directory
hierarchies of images can be placed online with minimal effort.

This is an *alpha* release.  Most of the functionality is here, but it's only
been lightly tested.  Documentation is probably lacking in some areas, and
the code generates copious debugging information to the error log.  I do not
recommend running this code on a production server.

After installing and testing AxKit, proceed as follows.

  * Install the two Perl modules (::Plugin and ::Provider) in the standard
    Perl fashion.

        perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make install

  * Identify the root directory of your image collection.  For example,
    /usr/local/pictures.

  * Create a directory to store the stylesheets (XSLT and XPathScript) that
    do the bulk of the transformation.  E.g., /usr/local/share/ax-app-gallery.
    Copy the contents of the stylesheets/ directory here

        mkdir /usr/local/share/ax-app-gallery
        cp stylesheets/* /usr/local/share/ax-app-gallery

  * Integrate the contents of httpd/httpd.conf into your Apache configuration
    file.  See the comments in that file for more details.

  * Restart the webserver

  * As part of the httpd.conf integration you should have created a URL on
    your website that maps back to the root directory of your image 
    collection (/usr/local/pictures, or whatever you called it).  Point
    a web browser at this URL.

    You should be rewarded with a page listing the subdirectories as links.
    Any images in this root directory should also be present as thumbnails.
    
    Clicking on a subdirectory should show you the images and subdirectories
    it contains.  Clicking on an image should show you a larger version of
    that image, some information about it, and links to view larger or 
    smaller versions of the image.

See the documentation in AxKit::App::Gallery for detailed configuration
information, author contact details, and troubleshooting/debugging
recommendations.
