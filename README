AxKit::App::Gallery
===================

$Id: README,v 1.3 2004/02/26 18:02:05 nik Exp $

This is an AxKit based image gallery, using XSLT and XPathScript.  Directory
hierarchies of images can be placed online with minimal effort.  To see
an example of AxKit::App::Gallery in use, go to

    http://jc.ngo.org.uk/pics/

See the INSTALL document for notes on installing AxKit::App::Gallery and
its dependencies.

After installing AxKit::App::Gallery;

  * Identify the root directory of your image collection.  For example,
    /usr/local/pictures.

  * Create a directory to store the stylesheets (XSLT and XPathScript) that
    do the bulk of the transformation.  E.g., /usr/local/share/ax-app-gallery.
    Copy the contents of the stylesheets/ directory here

        mkdir /usr/local/share/ax-app-gallery
        cp stylesheets/* /usr/local/share/ax-app-gallery

  * Edit proofsheet2html.xsl and imagesheet2html.xsl.  These both contain
    a statement that looks like this:

        <xsl:include href="file:///home/nik/Local-CVS/CPAN/AxKit::App::Gallery/src/stylesheets/breadcrumb.xsl"/>

    Adjust the path to reflect the full path to the file breadcrumb.xsl on
    your system.  Unfortunately, this is a side effect of interactions 
    between specific versions of XML::LibXML, XML::LibXSLT, and libxml.

    Future versions will hopefully fix this bug.

  * Integrate the contents of httpd/httpd.conf into your Apache configuration
    file.  See the comments in that file for more details.

  * Restart the webserver

  * As part of the httpd.conf integration you should have created a URL on
    your website that maps back to the root directory of your image 
    collection (/usr/local/pictures, or whatever you called it).  Point
    a web browser at this URL.

    You should be rewarded with a page listing the subdirectories as links.
    Any images in this root directory should also be present as thumbnails.
    
    Clicking on a subdirectory should show you the images and subdirectories
    it contains.  Clicking on an image should show you a larger version of
    that image, some information about it, and links to view larger or 
    smaller versions of the image.

See the documentation in AxKit::App::Gallery for detailed configuration
information, author contact details, and troubleshooting/debugging
recommendations.
